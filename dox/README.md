# `./dox/`

## Description

In order to avoid both redundant explanations of related symbols and to
unnecessarily enlarge the source files, the documentation information of some
symbols is provided by this directory.

Any symbol described in this directory has a `*.dox` file on its own, named
accordingly to the corresponding symbol.  This benefits not only the
maintainabilty of these docstrings but also the intuitive file purpose
recognition.

## Content
