/**
 * \brief   A simple ellipse class.
 *
 * This class represents an ellipse in a 3D space, oriented by a normal and a
 * tangent.
 *
 * The ellipse is assumed to be embedded into a plane whose normal will be used
 * in order to determine the orientation of the ellipse regarding front and back
 * faces.
 *
 * Since the ellipse can be rotated arbitrarily within its plane, a second
 * vector is required in order to determine which direction is up.  This
 * information is provided by the tangent.
